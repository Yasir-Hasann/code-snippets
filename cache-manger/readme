Set Up Redis Enterprise Cloud
1. Create an Account
Go to: https://redis.com/try-free/

Sign up and log in.
2. Create a New Redis Database
Click "New Subscription" or "Create Database"
Choose:
Cloud provider: AWS (or GCP, Azure)
Region: Closest to your server (same as your EC2 region for low latency)
Plan: Start with the Free or Fixed plan
Name: e.g., website-backend-cache
Leave defaults if unsure (e.g., no clustering yet)
Click Create Database

3. Get Your Connection Details
Once the DB is ready:
Go to your database's "Configuration" tab
You'll get:
Host (e.g., redis-12345.c15.us-east-1-2.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com)
Port (usually 12345)
Password
Copy these for client setup.
